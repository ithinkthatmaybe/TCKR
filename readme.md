#TCKR - For taking pretty motorised timelapse shots
------------


Does intervalometry and motion control for timelapse photography. All shutter and motion control is done with hard-time foreground scheduling using a roll-your-own real-time-clock/scheduler module.



Uses a rotary encoder and OLED which can be found for next to nothing here:

Also "easydriver" stepper drivers and nema14/17 motors.


3D printed part files to be uploaded soon.


Next on the Agenda
-Maybe play with some more extensive/adjustable menu structures 

-That could in turn allow for more some more cool things like loading preset shots stored in EEPROM

-The RTC (based on Martin Stienke's origional module we used for a wonderful ENCE361 project) could be extended to do lots of cool stuff, like task prioritisation, and even preemption.
